	<aside class="notes">Hi! I'm Bryan... We're going to talk about how libraries view privacy and how the law here in TN views privacy. We'll explore threat models, and how to think about patron privacy. Finally, we're cover some general principles of computer security that you can apply to your libraries' and your personal lives. This will be interactive. We'll mix it up. Exercise 1:
		"Are you a privacy vegan or a privacy nihilist... "
		"A parent without ID wants to see their child's record... "
		"A law enforcement officer with ID but no warrant wants to see a patron record... "
		"A "bounty hunter" wants to see a patron record a patron record... "

Librarians and other information workers support and participate in transparency so that the workings of government, administration and business are opened to the scrutiny of the general public.

<section>

<section>
	<aside class="notes">It's best to have a privacy policy that is available to the public. It should explain that data you collect, how you protect it, who you do and don't share it with, and that third parties the library interacts with might not have the same policies. I've included some sample policies. This just a gloss. Your homework is to read these policies, follow the link on the resources page at the end the book, and write a policy for the library. Go!
		Nashville & Seattle:
			They warn third parties are going to get your stuff.
		Nahman-Watson:
			Compare those to this one, a library is Massachusetts. It is very more detailed, but also has the caveat about third parties.

What if  the same scenario was framed as "yes, I will give away my Constitutional 4th amend rights, the rights that made the U.S. the envy of world, to see an ad for hotdogs." This what "personalization" means: surveillence so you can get ads.</aside>

Everytime you do this you expose yourself to more phishing attempts. Types harm that can come from privacy violations: identity theft, medical identity theft, doxing (blackmail, sextortion, swatting), stalking / partner abuse. Which is to say nothing of the qualitive costs: social isolation, emotional costs.</aside>

A notorious example was during the subprime mortage crisis when bad loans were heavily pushed at particular neighborhoods. Mosiac effect can be used to reverse engineer non-PII. You can learn someone's sex, gender, race, political affiliation, income, health info. This can lead to employment, housing, and education discrimination directly or indirectly. In short, all reasons we don't record what people read.</aside>

	<h3>COMPUTER STUFF</h3>
</section>

<section>
	<aside class="notes">When we started talking about PII we were already going there, so there is no turning back. ALA has created these handy checklists! Seriously, these are really great and readable and scalable. Perhaps more important than writing a privacy policy, is going through these checklists and applying the criteria to your library.

	There are some core concepts that run through these checklists. These can be applied to most of your duties at the library, or in your personal life, w/r/t privacy. Anything we talk about next can be applied to analog things too, so in that spirit we are going to start by rolling some dice.
